randomex
=======

_randomex_ implements a couple of random string generation functions used mostly for testing and is a repackage of the only useful part of [a package I did back when learning golang](https://github.com/vedranvuk/strings), now with added module support.

Additional functionality might be added later.


installation
============

`go get "github.com/vedranvuk/randomex"`
